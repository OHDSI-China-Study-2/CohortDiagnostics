#' Upload results to OHDSI server
#'
#' @details
#' This function uploads the 'Results_<databaseId>.zip' to the OHDSI SFTP server. Before sending, you
#' can inspect the zip file, which contains (zipped) CSV files. You can send the zip file from a
#' different computer than the one on which is was created.
#'
#' @param privateKeyFileName   A character string denoting the path to the RSA private key provided by
#'                             the study coordinator.
#' @param userName             A character string containing the user name provided by the study
#'                             coordinator.
#' @param outputFolder         Name of local folder where the results were generated; make sure to use
#'                             forward slashes (/). Do not use a folder on a network drive since this
#'                             greatly impacts performance.
